Why is some of my QFP data marked as \"Resolved QFP (Uncertain)\" and \"Unresolved QFP\"?\nNormally, TDC converts QFP data into a valid GPS position and marks the position as \"Resolved QFP\". These positions are about as accurate as traditional GPS locations. If the converted QFP data is not as accurate as a traditional GPS location, TDC marks the position as \"Resolved QFP (Uncertain)\". When TDC is unable to confirm the validity of a position, it marks the position as \"Unresolved QFP\". \"Unresolved QFP\" locations will be the least-accurate positions. Most of these positions will be accurate to within a few hundred meters; however, some positions may be very inaccurate (several km from the actual location). When analyzing your converted data, you may want to discard any outlying positions marked as \"Resolved QFP (Uncertain)\" or \"Unresolved QFP\".\n\nSource: Telonics Data Converter (2.64) Help file"}],"description":"Data dictionary for Telonics CSV files containing raw Iridium telemetry data.
